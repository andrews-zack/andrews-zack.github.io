##### The First Week
Coming into the Bootcamp, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. On one hand, I had the excitement of a new adventure and learning opportunity; and in the other, I knew the path ahead of me would not be an easy one. What I've experienced since the first day has been a good mix of those two ideas. My brain is excited to learn but has also caught a glimpse of what is to come.

I've always been a fan of puzzles, whether it is a mind-bending riddle or a 1000 piece jigsaw of some puppies, I sometimes can't get enough of them. That puzzle solving aspect of software engineering excites me the most, and I can't wait to tackle it in the coming weeks. Another thing I'm excited for is getting to know everyone else in the bootcamp. The few people I have had a chance to talk to and work alongside have been awesome.

Many people may not know this, but I grew up in Florida all the way up till college. Living close to the beach was amazing, but I often preferred the numerous natural springs that can be found dotted around the Sunshine State.
